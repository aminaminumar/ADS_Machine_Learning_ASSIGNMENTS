    "In Scikit-learn documentation you'll find a large list of ways to classify data. Do a little scavenger hunt in these docs: your goals is to look for classification methods and match a dataset in this curriculum, a question you can ask of it, and a technique of classification. Create a spreadsheet or table in a .doc file and explain how the dataset would work with the classification algorithm."

    "| Salary Dataset       | Predict if a person’s salary is “High” or “Low” based on experience | Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Converts salary into categories (High/Low). SVM finds the best decision boundary. Works well with small datasets. |\n",
    "| Pumpkin Dataset      | Predict if the average price in a given month is “Above Average” or “Below Average” | Random Forest         | Handles non-linear seasonal data. Robust, reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree. |\n",
